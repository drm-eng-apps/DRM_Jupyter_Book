# DRM's First Jupyter Book

The sole purpose of this repository is to test building [Jupyter Books](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/intro.html).

The intent of this "Jupyter Book Test Build" repository is for me to gain experience with building [Jupyter Books](https://github.com/executablebooks/jupyter-book).

I have since successfully built my first Jupyter Book and launched the book, via [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site), at: [https://drm-eng-apps.github.io/DRM_Jupyter_Book/intro.html](https://drm-eng-apps.github.io/DRM_Jupyter_Book/intro.html).

# Appreciation and Thanks

I'd like to extend my appreciation to @Tomas.Beuzen, @Hayle.Boyce, @Warren.Code, @Tiffany.Timbers, @Patrick.Walls, and @Peifan.Wu.
Their [UBC Jupyter Days 2020 - Jupyter Book Creation](https://ubc-dsci.github.io/jupyterdays/sessions/beuzen/jupyter_book_tutorial.html) Tutorial, hosted by the University of British Columbia, is an excellent resource for builidng Jupyter Books.
Other resources were not nearly as intuitive and easy to follow.
