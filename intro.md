# Intro
Welcome to the **DRM Jupyter Book**! This is my very first Jupyter Book publication, and is meant to test the features of building my own Jupyter Books for documenting my lifelong learning progression, as well as collaborating with like-minded people on different topics of interest!

This markdown file was made because whenever I try to build my Jupyter Book, I get thrown a `Sphinx error` as in:

```shell
Sphinx error:

root file /Users/.../DRM\_Jupyter\_Book/intro.rst not found

```
